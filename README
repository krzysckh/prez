HANDLERS
========

Handlers can be set in the configuration file.

- image_handler sets a program to run to show an image.
  It runs program with path to the image at the end.
  Defaults to "prez". If set as such, it will just show
  [IMAGE: filename].

  Recommended: imcat[1], img2txt[2], sxiv[3], prez_w3m_handler
  prez_w3m_handler is an experimental handler that uses
  w3mimgdisplay to show images in the terminal. to use it
  copy prez_w3m_handler to somewhere in the $PATH, and set
  image_handler to prez_w3m_handler.

- header_handler sets a program to run when rendering a header.
  It runs program with path to the image at the end.
  Defaults to "prez". If set as such, it will render a rather
  ugly header with letters defined in chars.h

  Recommended: figlet[4], toilet[5], banner[6]
